## Before anything you do
Before you install anything, `dima` is only compatible with DEBIAN GNU/Linux distributions so prepare to cry as you are banned from this tool. DEBIAN users can now proceed. You can join this project at anytime by joining our discord. Everything and everylinks are listed below.

## Installation
For the installation you will need to go in the "Releases" section and choose the latest release of them. Then, below the description you will need to download the `dima-<version>.deb`. Once downloaded, execute the file from your "Downloading" folder.

Once installed, run

	sudo apt update && upgrade
  
## Usage
`dima` has multiple option. They are being added as the releases. Sometimes, you may need to view them. That's why we implemented `-h` as the help command that lists commands and some intructions to the options.

To view them, run

	dima -h
